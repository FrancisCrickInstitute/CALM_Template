This is a template repository that we recommend as a starting point for making available online any code you use for the purposes of image analysis. This might include, but is not limited to...
* ImageJ/FIJI Macros
* CellProfiler pipelines
* ilastik projects
* Jupyter notebooks
* Python scripts
* MATLAB scripts

## Why?

It is often the case that publishing code is left until the last minute when a paper is being submitted, which results in published code that is in no way reusable. If the code is not reusable and cannot be run by anyone other than you, then nobody is going to be able to reproduce your published results! So, put as much time and effort into publishing your code as you do into writing the methods section of your paper.

## What Should You Include?

When publishing image analysis protocols, we recommend following the guidance in the following article:
